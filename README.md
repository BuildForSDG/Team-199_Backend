Bringing services to you, even if you don't have a formal address. For more info visit our project site: https://buildforsdg.github.io/Team-199/

##  The challenge

So many Africans do not live in formal housing and therefore also don’t have a formal address.

This excludes them from simple services such as getting items delivered to their door, to critical services if they need to be found by emergency services. 
Therefore WYR seeks to solve such a problem in a very simple way using [what3words](https://what3words.com/).

## About Us
We are a group of developers that entered Facebook Developer Circles and Andela’s challenge called [Build for Sustainable Development Goals](https://buildforsdg.andela.com/) or #BuildForSDG for short. For the innovation phase, we were grouped as [Team-199](https://buildforsdg.github.io/Team-199/whoweare/) and to come up with a solution to address social issues.
